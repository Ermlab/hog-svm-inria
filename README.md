# Pedestrian classification from photos using the Linear SVM and HOG features

## Introduction to HOG

HOG is an acronym for Histogram of Oriented Gradients. It's an algorithm called a feature descriptor which helps with object detection in computer vision and image processing models. HOG is a kind of feature descriptor that counts occurrences of gradient orientation in localized portions of an image.
